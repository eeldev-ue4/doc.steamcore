# Configuring SteamNetDriver
:::danger NOTE
The old SteamNetDriver is still available in Unreal Engine 4.27.x, however it is recommended that you switch to the SteamSockets NetDriver instead as it's more secure and updated.

## Verifying Your Configuration
To verify that youâ€™re using the SteamNetDriver you need to check your projects Log file when you launch your packaged project, open up your Project.log file and look for the following lines:

![LogFile](https://eeldev.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screenshot-2021-10-17-160243.png)

```c
LogSteamShared: Display: Loading Steam SDK 1.51
LogSteamShared: Steam SDK Loaded!
LogOnline: OSS: Creating online subsystem instance for: Steam
LogOnline: STEAM: Steam User is subscribed 1
LogOnline: STEAM: [AppId: 480] Client API initialized 1
LogOnline: STEAM: Initializing SteamNetworking Layer
LogOnline: STEAM: Missing P2PCleanupTimeout key in OnlineSubsystemSteam of DefaultEngine.ini, using default

```
If you find the SteamNetworking layer line then your project is using the correct SteamNetDriver
